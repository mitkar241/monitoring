## What is Elasticsearch?
---
[Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/what-is/elasticsearch) is a distributed, free and open search and analytics engine for all types of data, including textual, numerical, geospatial, structured, and unstructured. Elasticsearch is built on Apache Lucene and was first released in 2010 by Elasticsearch N.V. (now known as Elastic). Known for its simple REST APIs, distributed nature, speed, and scalability, Elasticsearch is the central component of the Elastic Stack, a set of free and open tools for data ingestion, enrichment, storage, analysis, and visualization. Commonly referred to as the ELK Stack (after Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana), the Elastic Stack now includes a rich collection of lightweight shipping agents known as Beats for sending data to Elasticsearch.

## What is Elasticsearch used for?
---
The speed and scalability of Elasticsearch and its ability to index many types of content mean that it can be used for a number of use cases:

- Application search
- Website search
- Enterprise search
- Logging and log analytics
- Infrastructure metrics and container monitoring
- Application performance monitoring
- Geospatial data analysis and visualization
- Security analytics
- Business analytics

## How does Elasticsearch work?
---
Raw data flows into Elasticsearch from a variety of sources, including logs, system metrics, and web applications. Data ingestion is the process by which this raw data is parsed, normalized, and enriched before it is indexed in Elasticsearch. Once indexed in Elasticsearch, users can run complex queries against their data and use aggregations to retrieve complex summaries of their data. From Kibana, users can create powerful visualizations of their data, share dashboards, and manage the Elastic Stack.

## What is an Elasticsearch index?
---
An Elasticsearch index is a collection of documents that are related to each other. Elasticsearch stores data as JSON documents. Each document correlates a set of keys (names of fields or properties) with their corresponding values (strings, numbers, Booleans, dates, arrays of values, geolocations, or other types of data).

Elasticsearch uses a data structure called an inverted index, which is designed to allow very fast full-text searches. An inverted index lists every unique word that appears in any document and identifies all of the documents each word occurs in.

During the indexing process, Elasticsearch stores documents and builds an inverted index to make the document data searchable in near real-time. Indexing is initiated with the index API, through which you can add or update a JSON document in a specific index.

## What programming languages does Elasticsearch support?
---
Elasticsearch supports a variety of languages and official clients are available for:

- Java
- JavaScript (Node.js)
- Go
- .NET (C#)
- PHP
- Perl
- Python
- Ruby
